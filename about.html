              <p>I have worked as a television news producer for nearly a decade.
                I have produced newscasts, telethons, investiagtion specials,
                and breaking news stories.  I had worked in central Pennsylvania
                and Seattle before leaving the industry.</p>

              <p>I have a bachelor's degree in Mass Communication from York College
                of Pennsylvania. I am also currently enrolled in the Epicodus coding
                bootcamp in Seattle, learning how to become a developer and hopefully
                get a job in the tech industry.</p>

              <p>To be honest, <strong>I burned out</strong>.  Producing TV news is not exactly a walk
                in the park. From political turmoil to breaking news, it is often
                a high stress environment.  Having to work holidays isn't great either.
                It was just time for a change.</p>

                    <p>There is <em>nothing better</em> than getting out into the backcountry
                      around Seattle. My summer weekends are typically spent sleeping
                      in tents.<a href="https://www.alltrails.com/members/sam-stoia">

                  <li><span class="hobbies">Barbeque</span></li>
                    <p>I loved smoked meats. After a trip to Austin, TX I decided
                      I had to learn how to re-create some of the bbq dishes I had down there.
                      Firing up the smoker and making something delicious is time consuming,
                      but worth it.</p>

                    <p>While still very new, I now find myself in a classroom 9 hours a day
                      learning how to code. If you've been thinking about learning how
                      to code as well, check out <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a></p>
