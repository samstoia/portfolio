              <p>I have worked as a television news producer for nearly a decade.
                I have produced newscasts, telethons, investiagtion specials,
                and breaking news stories.  I had worked in central Pennsylvania
                and Seattle before leaving the industry.</p>

              <p>I have a bachelor's degree in Mass Communication from York College
                of Pennsylvania. I am also currently enrolled in the Epicodus coding
                bootcamp in Seattle, learning how to become a developer and hopefully
                get a job in the tech industry.</p>

              <p>To be honest, I burned out.  Producing TV news is not exactly a walk
                in the park. From political turmoil to breaking news, it is often
                a high stress environment.  Having to work holidays isn't great either.
                It was just time for a change.</p>
